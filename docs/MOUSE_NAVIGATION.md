# Advanced Mouse Navigation System for Sokoban

## Overview

The Advanced Mouse Navigation System transforms the traditional keyboard-only Sokoban experience into an intuitive, mouse-driven interface while preserving all original game mechanics and puzzle-solving logic.

## Features

### üéØ Dynamic Guideline System
- **Real-time pathfinding**: White guideline traces dynamically from player to cursor position

- **Smooth rendering**: Anti-aliased lines with directional arrows

### üñ±Ô∏è Intelligent Navigation
- **Left-click movement**: Click anywhere to automatically navigate along the calculated path
- **Obstacle handling**: Automatically stops before unmovable boxes when no bypass exists
- **Collision detection**: Respects all game rules including walls and box physics
- **Animation integration**: Seamlessly works with existing sprite animations

### üì¶ Drag-and-Drop Box Manipulation
- **Intuitive controls**: Click and drag boxes adjacent to the player
- **Multi-tile movement**: Move boxes across multiple tiles in one drag operation
- **Direction detection**: Automatically determines movement direction from mouse motion
- **Physics compliance**: Maintains all Sokoban rules during drag operations

### üîÑ Seamless Integration
- **Hybrid control**: Mouse and keyboard controls work together harmoniously
- **State preservation**: Maintains undo history and game statistics
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient pathfinding with configurable limits
- **Visual consistency**: Matches existing game UI and theme

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### MouseNavigationSystem Class
```python
class MouseNavigationSystem:
    """Advanced mouse navigation with pathfinding and drag-drop."""
    
    # Key features:
    - A* pathfinding algorithm
    - Real-time path calculation
    - Drag-and-drop state management
    - Visual rendering system
```

#### Pathfinding Algorithm
- **Algorithm**: A* with Manhattan distance heuristic
- **Optimization**: Configurable search limits to prevent infinite loops
- **Fallback**: Finds closest reachable position when direct path unavailable
- **Performance**: Efficient node management with hash-based lookups

#### Visual Rendering
- **Guideline**: Semi-transparent white line with directional arrows
- **Path highlighting**: Subtle tile highlighting along calculated route
- **Dynamic updates**: Real-time recalculation as mouse moves
- **Scaling support**: Works with zoom and fullscreen modes

### Integration Points

#### Event Handling
```python
# Mouse events integrated into main game loop
pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN  # Navigation clicks and drag start
pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP    # Drag end
pygame.MOUSEMOTION      # Drag operations and path updates
```

#### Game State Management
```python
# Automatic integration with existing systems
- Level transitions: Navigation state cleared
- Undo operations: Compatible with move history
- Reset functionality: Navigation state reset
- Completion detection: Navigation cleared on level completion
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Navigation
1. **Move mouse** over the game area to see the white guideline
2. **Left-click** anywhere to start automatic navigation
3. **Watch** as the player follows the calculated path
4. **Continue playing** with keyboard controls as normal

### Box Manipulation
1. **Position** the player adjacent to a box
2. **Click and hold** on the box to start dragging
3. **Drag** in the desired direction to move box and player
4. **Release** to return to normal navigation mode

### Advanced Features
- **Pathfinding**: System automatically finds optimal routes around obstacles
- **Obstacle handling**: Stops gracefully when encountering unmovable boxes
- **Multi-directional**: Supports movement in all four cardinal directions
- **Zoom compatibility**: Works seamlessly with zoom and scroll features

## Configuration Options

### Navigation Settings
```python
# Pathfinding parameters
max_path_length = 100        # Maximum search depth
movement_speed = 200         # Milliseconds between moves

# Visual settings
guideline_color = (255, 255, 255, 180)  # White with transparency
guideline_width = 3                      # Line thickness
highlight_color = (255, 255, 255, 100)  # Path tile highlighting
```

### Performance Tuning
- **Search limits**: Prevent infinite pathfinding loops
- **Update frequency**: Balance responsiveness with performance
- **Rendering optimization**: Efficient surface management
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of navigation data

- **Memory Usage**: Minimal additional overhead
- **Frame Rate Impact**: Negligible on modern systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Navigation Not Working
- **Check**: Mouse is over the game area
- **Verify**: Level is loaded and game is not paused
- **Ensure**: No modal dialogs are open

#### Pathfinding Seems Slow
- **Reduce**: `max_path_length` setting
- **Check**: Level complexity (very large levels may be slower)
- **Verify**: System performance is adequate

#### Drag-and-Drop Not Responding
- **Confirm**: Player is adjacent to the box
- **Check**: Box can be moved in the intended direction
- **Verify**: No other boxes or walls block the path
