# Testing the Responsive UI Layout System

This document provides a test plan for verifying that the responsive UI layout system is working correctly. Follow these steps to ensure that the UI elements adjust properly when the window is resized, that the layout works on different screen sizes, and that no functionality is broken.

## Test Plan

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

- [ ] Launch the game and verify that the main menu appears correctly
- [ ] Navigate through all menu screens (Play, Editor, Settings, Skins, Credits) and verify that they display correctly
- [ ] Test all buttons to ensure they respond to mouse hover and clicks
- [ ] Verify that the level selector displays categories and levels correctly
- [ ] Test level selection and ensure that levels load properly

### 2. Window Resizing Tests

- [ ] Start the game in windowed mode
- [ ] Resize the window to different dimensions:
  - [ ] Make it wider (e.g., 1200x600)
  - [ ] Make it taller (e.g., 800x900)
  - [ ] Make it both wider and taller (e.g., 1200x900)
  - [ ] Make it smaller (e.g., 800x600)
- [ ] For each resize, verify that:
  - [ ] All UI elements remain visible and properly positioned
  - [ ] Text remains readable
  - [ ] Buttons remain clickable
  - [ ] Scrollbars adjust appropriately
  - [ ] The layout maintains its overall structure

### 3. Different Screen Resolution Tests

- [ ] Test the game on different screen resolutions:
  - [ ] Low resolution (e.g., 800x600)
  - [ ] Medium resolution (e.g., 1280x720)
  - [ ] High resolution (e.g., 1920x1080)
  - [ ] Very high resolution (e.g., 2560x1440 or 3840x2160, if available)
- [ ] For each resolution, verify that:
  - [ ] The UI scales appropriately
  - [ ] Text sizes are appropriate for the resolution
  - [ ] Button sizes are appropriate for the resolution
  - [ ] The layout uses the available space effectively

### 4. Fullscreen Mode Tests

- [ ] Toggle fullscreen mode (F11)
- [ ] Verify that all UI elements adjust correctly to the fullscreen dimensions
- [ ] Navigate through all menu screens in fullscreen mode
- [ ] Toggle back to windowed mode and verify that the UI readjusts correctly

### 5. Edge Case Tests

- [ ] Test with extremely wide aspect ratios (e.g., 21:9 ultrawide)
- [ ] Test with extremely narrow windows
- [ ] Test with extremely short windows
- [ ] Test rapid window resizing (resize quickly multiple times)
- [ ] Test resizing while navigating between different menu screens

### 6. Functional Regression Tests

- [ ] Play through several levels to ensure that the game mechanics still work correctly
- [ ] Test the level editor functionality
- [ ] Test the settings menu and verify that changes are applied correctly
- [ ] Test the skins menu and verify that skin changes are applied correctly

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing, please document them with the following information:

1. Test case that failed
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots (if applicable)
6. System information (OS, screen resolution, etc.)

## Conclusion

Once all tests have passed, the responsive UI layout system can be considered fully implemented and ready for use. If any issues are found, they should be addressed before considering the implementation complete.
